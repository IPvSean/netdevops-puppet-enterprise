## Manifest descriptions
- /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production/manifests/site.pp - this is the main manifest to provision the network with [OSPF Unnumbered](http://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/CL25/Open+Shortest+Path+First+-+OSPF+-+Protocol).  Each node is given a single IP address instead of burning (using up) an IP address per link.
- /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/spine2swap/manifests/site.pp - this manifest runs when spine2 (4.4.4.4) has been identified to have a bad fan
