# This example configuration details the most commonly used configuration
# options for the `r10k deploy` command.
#

# The 'cachedir' setting controls where cached content, such as mirrored Git
# repositories, are stored on the local machine. This location should be
# persistent, as environments and modules may rely on these files in order to
# be updated.
#
# The default value is "~/.r10k"
cachedir: '/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/r10k'

# The 'sources' setting determines what repositories r10k will use when creating
# Puppet environments.
sources:
  # Each source should have a unique name, and preferrably should only use
  # alphanumeric characters and underscores.
  operations:

    # The 'remote' setting determines the location of the VCS repository used
    # for creating environments.
    remote: 'git@github.com:my-org/org-operations-modules'

    # The 'basedir' setting specifies where environments will be created for
    # this source. This setting should match the Puppet 'environmentpath'
    # setting in puppet.conf.
    #
    # See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#environmentpath
    # for more information about the Puppet 'environmentpath' setting.
    basedir: '/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments'

  # One or more sources can be specified; each source is simple another entry
  # in the sources map.
  qa:
    remote: 'git@github.com:my-org/org-qa-modules'

    # Multiple sources can have the same 'basedir' setting, in case there is a
    # reason to push different sets of environments to the same Puppet master.
    # If two different sources have the same basedir care should be exercised
    # to make sure that two sources don't try create multiple environments with
    # the same name. See the 'prefix' setting for more information.
    basedir: '/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments'

    # Sources can use the 'prefix' setting to avoid collisions between multiple
    # sources being created in the same directory. Setting prefix to true
    # prepends the source name and an underscore to each environment, so for
    # the qa source the "production" branch will create the "qa_production"
    # branch.
    #
    # The default value is 'false'.
    prefix: true

# Additional configuration can be supplied to configure how r10k uses Git
# and what version of Git it uses.
git:

  # As of 1.5.0 r10k can interact with Git repositories in two ways - by
  # shelling out to the 'git' executable, and by using libgit2 through the
  # 'rugged' library.
  provider: 'shellgit' # Either 'shellgit' or 'rugged', defaults to 'shellgit'

  # The 'private_key' setting sets the the SSH private key to use for remote
  # Git repositories accessed over SSH.
  #
  # The 'private_key' setting is only used by the 'rugged' Git provider.
  #private_key: '/root/.ssh/id_rsa'

  # The 'username' setting sets the SSH username for remote Git repositories
  # when a username is not provided in the URL. The username defaults to the
  # current user.
  #
  # The 'username' setting is only used by the 'rugged' Git provider.
  #username: 'git'

# Configuration options for downloading modules from the Puppet Forge
forge:
  # The 'proxy' setting specifies an optional HTTP proxy to use when making
  # requests to the Puppet Forge.
  proxy: 'http://my.site.proxy:3128'
